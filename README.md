## Project Structure

The Cloud Home project is divided into two main folders:

### 1. **Frontend**

The `frontend` folder contains the client-side application, developed using React. It is responsible for the user interface and user experience.

**Key Files and Folders**:
- `src/` - Contains the source code for the React application.
- `public/` - Includes static assets like HTML and images.
- `package.json` - Manages project dependencies and scripts.

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 2. **Backend**

The `backend` folder houses the server-side application built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles API requests, authentication, and database operations.

**Key Files and Folders**:
- `src/` - Contains server-side code, including API routes and authentication logic.
- `config/` - Configuration files, including environment variables.
- `package.json` - Manages backend project dependencies and scripts.

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
